## Availability of Support

Support is not available. Use Red at your own peril. 
As the contributor with the most code and expertise contributed to red, 
I was banned for saying I was tired of having my work misrepresented and lied about by organization members.
I threw down an ultimatum to get it to stop, they banned me, I'll be following through with what I said.

## Whats here?

Various addons for Red Discordbot. Most of these are focused around utility purposes.


### AntiMentionSpam

This cog provides automated actions against people spamming mentions.

Configuration is available via the `antimentionspam` command.


### BanSync

This cog provides a few functions for handling bans across multiple servers.

More help is available via `help BanSync`


### ChannelRedirect

This cog can lock commands down to specific channels, with exceptions.

This cog does not disable or otherwise interfere with licenseinfo.

### EmbedMaker

This cog provides a means to create, store, and send embedded messages from the bot.

Full documentation is still pending,
but a robust example is available
[here](https://gist.github.com/mikeshardmind/0e15779370d7761a8608ce94936721ed) for now

### GuildJoinRestrict

Allows controlling and logging which guilds the bot can join based on configurable settings
and either an allowlist or blocklist.

Tip: If you do not want the bot taking these actions automatically,
or just want a log of guilds the bot has joined, set up a discord log channel,
use the allowlist mode with an empty allowlist, and do not turn on autoleaving.

### MentionHelp

This cog provides people who mention the bot a bit of assistance
in finding the help command and a valid prefix should they need it.

### ModOnlyMode

This cog is for locking a bot's usage to mods and admins (on a per sever basis).

This cog does not disable or otherwise interfere with licenseinfo.

### QuoteTools

Provides a quick way to reference other messages without needing to jump to them to view.

### Relays

Mirror messages sent in a channel to other channels.

### RoleManagement

Provides:

 - Reaction roles
 - Self roles
 - Purchasable roles
 - User list data based on roles
 - Mass Role modifications
 
Note: Roles self assigned via reaction or command are subject to
the settings configured in the `roleset` command.

This cog has some additional information documented [here](rolemanagement/README.md)

### RoomTools

Provides two seperate ways to allow users to create temporary channels.

For command based temporary voice channels, see the `tempchannelset` command

For temporary channels generated automatically, see the `autoroomset` command

## What about the other cogs not listed here?

Use at your own risk, they are disabled, hidden, undocumented,
or intended to be replaced by newer alternatives.

They aren't designed to actively cause harm, but I'm not advertising them.

## Why weren't you working on this/as invested in this anymore?

Significant personal disagreements which led to wanting to have nothing to do with Red's community.

Then being banned for taking issue with my work being misrepresented and TwentySix repeatedly lying about it.

## Why are you working on this again?

I'm no longer. All further of my own use will be done wlewhere.

## Custom forks

Read the license, but disallowed.
